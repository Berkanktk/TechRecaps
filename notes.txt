Kubernetes
A container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Key Components:
Nodes: Servers running the containers (roles include Control-Plane, Etcd, Worker).
Worker: A node in a Kubernetes cluster that runs application workloads. Communicates with the control-plane to receive instructions and updates
Control Plane: Coordinates the cluster, managing nodes and workloads.
Etcd: Stores configuration data and cluster state in a key/value store.
Pods: Smallest deployable unit, representing one or more containers sharing the same network and storage. Represents a single instance of a container
Deployments: Manages the lifecycle of pods, enabling updates and scaling.
Services: Exposes pods to the network and handles load balancing.
ConfigMap and Secret: Resources for managing configuration data and sensitive information.
Persistent Volume: Provides storage decoupled from pod lifecycles.
Persistent Volume Claim: A Kubernetes resource that requests a specific amount and type of storage resource from a cluster's available persistent volume pool (fancy talk for “mount”)
Kubernetes API: Set of RESTful APIs for managing the cluster resources, such as pods, deployments, and services
Ingress: Manages external access to services within a cluster commonly http/https
Load Balancer: A Kubernetes resource that automatically distributes incoming network traffic to multiple replicas of a service or application, improving availability and scalability

Advantages of Kubernetes:
Scalability: Dynamically scales resources based on demand.
High Availability: Replaces failed containers automatically.
Flexibility: Runs various containerized applications, including stateful workloads.
Separation of concerns: Common language and platform for developers.
Segregation of Duties: Implements role-based access control (RBAC).
